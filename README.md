 # The Problem It Solves

Postpartum recovery is a challenging and critical period for mothers, yet it often lacks adequate support. Many mothers face physical, emotional, and mental health challenges while simultaneously trying to care for their newborns. The lack of personalized care, limited access to mental health resources, and insufficient guidance make postpartum recovery overwhelming. According to the World Health Organization, around 287,000 women die each year globally due to complications related to pregnancy and childbirth, which includes postpartum complications, meaning a woman dies roughly every two minutes due to pregnancy or childbirth issues; the majority of these deaths occur in low-resource countries. We envision a world where all women have the opportunity to enter motherhood and not only survive, but thrive.
